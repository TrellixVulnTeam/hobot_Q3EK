## Guide to your next booking

Introduction
============

**Not only can chatbots be prepared to display the features, services, and attractions of the service, with an appropriate script they can guide website visitors through the path of making a booking.**
**With Machine Learning, chatbots not only keep improving the answers, they also improve their creation of the potential customer profile.**

It's compatible with Python versions **3.7+**

An example of typical input would be something like this:

> **user:** Good morning! How are you doing?  
> **bot:**  I am doing very well, thank you for asking.  
> **user:** You're welcome.  
> **bot:** Do you like hats?  

## How it works

An untrained instance of ChatterBot starts off with no knowledge of how to communicate. Each time a user enters a statement, the library saves the text that they entered and the text that the statement was in response to. As ChatterBot receives more input the number of responses that it can reply and the accuracy of each response in relation to the input statement increase. The program selects the closest matching response by searching for the closest matching known statement that matches the input, it then returns the most likely response to that statement based on how frequently each response is issued by the people the bot communicates with.

## Installation

This package can be installed from [PyPi](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/ChatterBot) by running:
